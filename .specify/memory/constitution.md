# AI/Spec-Driven Unified Book Creation using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through Direct Verification
All factual and technical claims must be verifiable through credible sources; All explanations must be beginner-friendly while remaining technically correct. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the content produced by the AI-assisted system.

### Clarity and Accessibility
Content must be clear, precise, and structured with professional, educational, and practical tone for a technical audience (students, developers, and AI engineers). This ensures that the book is accessible to the intended readership level.

### AI-Native Development with Human-in-the-Loop Validation
AI-generated content must be reviewed, edited, and validated by humans; No hallucinated concepts, tools, or references are allowed. This maintains quality control while leveraging AI capabilities effectively.

### Reproducibility of Content, Structure, and Workflow
All chapters must follow a consistent documentation structure defined by Spec-Kit Plus; Version control must be maintained via GitHub. This ensures that the development process can be reproduced and validated by others.

### Transparency of Sources, Tools, and Generation Process
Source & Citation Rules: Minimum 60% sources from official documentation, research papers, or authoritative technical platforms; All reused ideas must be rewritten originally with proper attribution. This maintains academic and professional integrity.

### Continuous Improvement Through Iterative Refinement
Content must be continuously improved through iterative refinement. This allows for ongoing enhancement of quality and accuracy based on feedback and new information.

## Technical Constraints
Platform: Docusaurus; Deployment: GitHub Pages; Tooling: Spec-Kit Plus for specification-driven structure, Claude Code for AI-assisted content generation; All content must be written in Markdown; The book must build successfully with zero build errors. These constraints ensure technical consistency and deployment reliability.

## Development Workflow and Quality Standards
Each chapter must include: Concept explanation, Practical example, Use case or real-world application, Summary; Code examples must be runnable, minimal, and clearly explained; Citations must be consistently formatted; All diagrams must be either original or properly attributed. These standards ensure high-quality, educational content.

## Governance
All content must be verified against primary and trusted technical sources; AI is used as a co-author, not a replacement for human judgment; All misleading, biased, or unverifiable content must be removed; Safety, privacy, and responsible AI principles must be respected at all stages. These governance rules ensure ethical and quality standards are maintained throughout the development process.
