# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module integrates multimodal AI systems that combine vision, language, and action capabilities, enabling humanoid robots to understand natural language commands and execute appropriate physical actions based on visual context.

## Chapter Overview

- **Chapter 4.1: Vision-Language Models for Robot Command Understanding** - Integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with humanoid robots to enable natural language command interpretation
- **Chapter 4.2: Action Generation and Execution from Visual-Language Input** - Translates visual-language understanding into executable robot actions
- **Chapter 4.3: Capstone Integration - The Autonomous Humanoid System** - Integrates all previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Integrate vision-language models with humanoid robots
- Translate natural language commands into robot actions
- Implement multimodal AI systems for complex robot behaviors
- Integrate all system components into a cohesive autonomous humanoid

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1-3
- OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
- LLM integration set up
- NVIDIA NIM (Natural Language Microservices) configured
