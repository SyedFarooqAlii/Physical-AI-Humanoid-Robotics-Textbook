# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book covers the integration of ROS 2, Digital Twin technologies, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems to create autonomous humanoid robots.

## Overview

This book is structured into four core modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Covers the foundational ROS 2 communication architecture for humanoid robotics
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explores simulation environments for robot development and testing
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Focuses on AI-driven perception and control systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrates multimodal AI for complex robot behaviors

Each module builds upon the previous ones, culminating in the capstone project: an autonomous humanoid system capable of receiving voice commands, understanding visual scenes, planning complex tasks, and executing physical actions.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI and ML practitioners interested in robotics applications
- Students studying robotics at the senior undergraduate or early graduate level
- Developers working on autonomous systems

## Prerequisites

Readers should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with programming (Python/C++)
- Knowledge of Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Understanding of AI/ML fundamentals (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational ROS 2 architecture, then progress through each module sequentially. The capstone project integrates all concepts from the previous modules.
