# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module covers the foundational ROS 2 communication architecture that enables distributed control of humanoid robot systems, ensuring real-time message passing between perception, planning, and control nodes while maintaining system reliability and low latency.

## Chapter Overview

- **Chapter 1.1: ROS 2 Architecture for Humanoid Robotics** - Establishes the foundational ROS 2 communication architecture
- **Chapter 1.2: Real-Time Control with ROS 2 for Humanoid Dynamics** - Implements real-time control loops for humanoid balance, walking, and manipulation
- **Chapter 1.3: Multi-Node Coordination and Safety Systems** - Designs safety-critical coordination mechanisms between multiple ROS 2 nodes

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Design ROS 2 communication architectures for humanoid robots
- Implement real-time control systems with deterministic response times
- Create safety-critical coordination mechanisms between nodes
- Understand the simulation vs real-world deployment boundaries

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Development environment set up per the quickstart guide
