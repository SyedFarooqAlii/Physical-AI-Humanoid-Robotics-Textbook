# Capstone Integration: The Autonomous Humanoid System

This section covers the integration of all previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system. It demonstrates voice commands, cognitive planning, ROS 2 actions, navigation, vision, and manipulation working together.

## Overview

The capstone integration brings together all four modules into a unified autonomous system:

- Voice command processing pipeline
- LLM cognitive planning integrated with ROS 2 action execution
- Navigation system connected with perception and planning modules
- Manipulation capabilities with vision feedback

## Components

1. **Capstone Integration Specification** - Complete system integration requirements
2. **Demonstration Scenarios** - Example scenarios showcasing system capabilities
3. **Validation and Testing** - Procedures to validate integrated system functionality

This capstone demonstrates how all modules work together in a complete autonomous humanoid system capable of receiving voice commands and executing complex tasks.
