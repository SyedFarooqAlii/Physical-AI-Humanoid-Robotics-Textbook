# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module covers the foundational communication architecture for humanoid robotics systems using ROS 2. It includes detailed specifications for distributed communication patterns and real-time performance optimization.

## Overview

Module 1 establishes the communication backbone of the humanoid robotics system using ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill. This includes:

- Communication architecture with proper QoS profiles
- Distributed communication patterns for multi-robot systems
- Real-time performance optimization for control systems

## Chapters

1. **Communication Architecture** - Detailed ROS 2 communication patterns and interface specifications
2. **Distributed Communication Patterns** - Multi-robot and distributed system communication
3. **Real-time Performance Optimization** - Optimizing ROS 2 for real-time humanoid control

This module serves as the nervous system of the humanoid robot, enabling reliable and efficient communication between all subsystems.
