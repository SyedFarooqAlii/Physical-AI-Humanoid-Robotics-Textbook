# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module covers simulation environments and sim-to-real transfer methodologies for humanoid robotics systems. It includes detailed specifications for Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim environments.

## Overview

Module 2 establishes the digital twin infrastructure for humanoid robotics development using multiple simulation platforms:

- Simulation environment architecture with Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim
- Simulation fidelity optimization techniques
- Sim-to-real transfer methodologies for deployment

## Chapters

1. **Simulation Environment Architecture** - Designing simulation environments for humanoid robotics
2. **Simulation Fidelity Optimization** - Techniques to optimize simulation accuracy and performance
3. **Sim-to-Real Transfer Methodologies** - Methods for transferring learned behaviors from simulation to reality

This module serves as the virtual testing ground for the humanoid robot, enabling safe development and testing before real-world deployments.
