# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module covers the AI perception, planning, and control systems for humanoid robotics. It includes detailed specifications for cognitive architectures and adaptive learning algorithms.

## Overview

Module 3 establishes the artificial intelligence infrastructure for humanoid robotics using NVIDIA Isaac:

- Perception-planning-control architecture for intelligent behavior
- Cognitive architecture patterns for decision making
- Adaptive learning algorithms for continuous improvement

## Chapters

1. **Perception-Planning-Control Architecture** - The cognitive architecture for humanoid decision making
2. **Cognitive Architecture Patterns** - Design patterns for intelligent robot behavior
3. **Adaptive Learning Algorithms** - Machine learning techniques for continuous improvement

This module serves as the cognitive center of the humanoid robot, enabling intelligent perception, planning, and action.
