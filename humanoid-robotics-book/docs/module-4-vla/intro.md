# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module covers multimodal AI integration for humanoid robotics systems. It includes detailed specifications for vision-language-action integration and context-aware interaction models.

## Overview

Module 4 establishes the multimodal interaction infrastructure for humanoid robotics:

- Multimodal integration architecture combining vision, language, and action
- Multimodal fusion techniques for sensor integration
- Context-aware interaction models for human-robot interaction

## Chapters

1. **Multimodal Integration Architecture** - Architecture for combining multiple sensory modalities
2. **Multimodal Fusion Techniques** - Techniques for fusing information from different sensors
3. **Context-Aware Interaction Models** - Models for understanding and responding to context

This module serves as the multimodal interface of the humanoid robot, enabling natural interaction through vision, language, and action.
